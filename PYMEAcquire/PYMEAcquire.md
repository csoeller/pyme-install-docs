# Setting up for acquisition using PYMEAcquire

## Rationale

We (and others) are generally finding that most commercial system we have tried have relatively woeful software support once you have been used to the PYME infrastructure.

This is no attempt at putting down commercial systems, it might reflect that we haven't yet tried a particular brand/model that fixes all of these shortcomings. Alternatively, the industry is not yet mature enough to have quite got there. In that case, ideally they would look at the standout PYME features and just copy the best ;).

The rationale of these and accompanying notes in this directory is to document our setup procedure as we work through potential issues, find workarounds where necessary etc. This could help others to try something similar. Most importantly, it should serve as a record to remind us of procedures, collect links to useful info and tricks as we try to replicate installations or fix recurring issues.

## PYMEAcquire

The application that will run our setup is called `PYMEAcquire`  and there is some documentation at [python-microscopy.org](http://python-microscopy.org).

Most of the setup/installation process involves identifying necessary support software (drivers, SDKs, etc) and writing of suitable initialisation and configuration files. We aim to cover different hardware components in the various documents in this folder.
