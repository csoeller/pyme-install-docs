# IDS camera setup

## Install relevant software

Get software from [https://de.ids-imaging.com/downloads.html](https://de.ids-imaging.com/downloads.html). Find your model and download the relevant support software for windows, 64 bit. This needs an IDS login account (which I made several years go). Note that their software is provided free of charge.

### Installation

There is generally an installer provided in a zip file. Execute that installer, I went with the default selections which seemed fine. For me the version was called `ids-software-suite-win-4.95`.

### Initial testing

Run their `ueye-demo` which should allow detecting and starting the relevant camera.

### Find relevant DLLs

**TODO**...

### Setup relevant launcher

**TODO**...
